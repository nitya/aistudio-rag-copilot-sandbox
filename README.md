# Build a RAG-based Custom Copilot Code-First on Azure AI 

## Introducing Contoso Chat

[Contoso Chat](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat) is an open-source reference sample that implements an end-to-end solution for a **retail copilot** based on your data. The reference sample showcases the following tools and features:
 - Application **design** with [Prompty](https://prompty.ai) templates.
 - Application **development** with [Promptflow](https://aka.ms/promptflow) flex flows.
 - Application **evaluation** with [Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/promptflow) tooling
 - Application **provisioning** and **deployment**  with [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd)

The sample comes with workshop-style instructions to **deconstruct** the end-to-end development workflow, and get hands-on experience with how a custom copilot solution is built **code-first** with Azure AI tools and services.

## Reconstructing Contoso Chat

This repository focuses on **reconstructing** that experience from scratch, building a custom copilot with your data step-by-step, using the following resources. Along the way, we'll get more familiar with core concepts for generative AI, core developer tools for Azure AI, and the LLMOps end-to-end workflow from prompt design to production deployment.
