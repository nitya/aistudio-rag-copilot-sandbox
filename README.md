# Reconstructing: RAG-based Copilot Code-First on Azure AI

The [Contoso Chat](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat) open-source reference sample provides an pre-built end-to-end solution for a custom copilot built code-first with Azure AI. The sample showcases the following tools and features:
 - **Design** application prompts with [Prompty](https://prompty.ai)
 - **Develop** application flows with [Promptflow](https://aka.ms/promptflow)
 - **Evaluate** application flows with [Prompt-Eval](https://aka.ms/promptflow)
 - **Deploy** application with [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd)

Project to explore the Azure AI Studio RAG-based Copilot tutorials and documentation - with the goal of having a sandbox to explore related tools, techniques and best practices
