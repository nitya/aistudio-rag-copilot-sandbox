# Overview

!!!example "Workshop Objectives"

    This series of hands-on labs teaches you to build, configure, evaluate, deploy, and use, a **custom copilot** built code-first with Azure-AI, using the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) design pattern, for a retail store scenario. The instructions follow guidance from the [Azure AI Studio documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/copilot-sdk-build-rag?tabs=azure-portal) and the [Contoso Chat](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat) application sample.

    This is a **self-serve** workshop for completion at your own pace. The instructions will emphasize a _happy path_ to get you quickly to the desired goal of a deployed copilot. However, exercises may offer _alternative paths_ for exploration of new tools, models etc. that are intended to build your comprehension and intuition.

    This lab **may be used in instructor-led sessions** at physical events. In that case, some steps (e.g., provisioning of infrastructure) may be completed for you. Refer to the instructor guidance at the event for next steps.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop you should be able to:

 - Describe the **Azure AI Studio** platform and developer tooling
 - Describe the **LLMOps workflow** and end-to-end application lifecycle
 - Build, evaluate, and deploy, a **custom RAG-based copilot** code-first
 - Understand how to customize or adapt the solution with **your own data**.


## What You'll Need

You will need a laptop for this lab, along with:

 - A **GitHub account** (with GitHub Codespaces access)
 - An **Azure account** (with Azure OpenAI access)
 - A **modern browser** (to run GitHUb Codespaces)
 - Familiarity with **Visual Studio Code** (recommended IDE)
 - Familiarity with **Python and Jupyter Notebooks** (default SDK)

## What You'll Do

By the end of this workshop, you should know how to build a custom copilot application, code-first, using Azure AI tools and services. This includes being able to execute these steps for an end-to-end developer workflow (LLMOps):

1. **Define It** - Describe the prioritized scenarios and data requirements.
1. **Provision It** - Setup required infrastructure & local dev environment.
1. **Develop It** - Use best-in-class developer tools to prototype prompts, flow.
1. **Evaluate It** - Validate prototype for quality & safety, learn key metrics.
1. **Deploy it** - Deploy AI application for hosted API endpoint, test it out.
1. **Deliver it** - Explore Monitoring (App Insights), Safety (Content Filters).

## Under The Hood

Want to learn more about the key tools and concepts used in this workshop? Watch this Microsoft Build 2024 breakout talk for a deep dive into LLMOps and code-first development.

!!!info "BRK110: Abstract"

    Learn how to get from prototype to production with LLMOps and new developer tools for iterative debugging, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Weâ€™ll test and troubleshoot a copilot app using the code-first prompt flow SDK and frameworks like LangChain, interactively debugging an LLM chat application with VS Code. Then weâ€™ll make sure it meets our thresholds for performance and safety, ship it, and ensure we can collect critical signals in production.
