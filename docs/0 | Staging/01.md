# 1. Provision Resources

Setup an Azure AI Hub and Project for the retail copilot implementation using one of these options:
 -  [Low-code option](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/quickstarts/get-started-playground) - using Azure AI Studio UI
 - [Code-first option](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/create-hub-project-sdk?tabs=python) - using Azure AI Studio SDK (Python) or Azure CLI (Terminal)
 - [ARM-template option](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-hub-template?tabs=cli) - using Azure Dev CLI (Terminal) with Infrastructure-as-code.

At the end of this step you should have provisioned an Azure AI Hub, AI Project and AI Services resources - with _connections_ to support client interactions with deployed AI services - for your copilot solution. **With option 3, you will also provision support services like CosmosDB**.
